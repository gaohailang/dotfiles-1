# Custom Plugins and Themes

# If you want to override any of the default behaviors, just add a new file (ending in .zsh) in the custom/ directory.

# If you have many functions that go well together, you can put them as a XYZ.plugin.zsh file in the custom/plugins/ directory and then enable this plugin.

# If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with Oh My Zsh, create a plugin of the same name in the custom/plugins/ directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in plugins/.
